## 🎯 What Is This?

RiskRadar analyzes legal contracts the way an adversary would — not as a grammar checker, but as a **contract hacker**. It answers the question every party should ask before signing:

> *"How can the other side legally exploit this contract against me?"*

Upload or paste any contract and get a full adversarial breakdown in seconds.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Clause-Level Analysis
Every clause is tagged, dissected, and stress-tested for structural defects — ambiguity, unilateral control, missing dependencies, and silence mechanisms.

### 🔗 Cross-Clause Exploit Chains
Most real contract risks don't live in one clause — they emerge from combinations. RiskRadar maps **clause interaction chains** like:
- `Payment + Termination` → money kept without delivery
- `Payment + Completion + IP` → paid in full, owns nothing
- `Delivery + Acceptance + Silence` → defective work legally accepted

### 💣 Abuse Simulations
Step-by-step, realistic scenarios showing exactly how each exploit plays out in the real world — with financial and legal impact named concretely.

### 🔒 Ownership Block Detection
Detects the **"Paid But No Ownership"** trap — when a Client pays the full contract value but never legally receives the intellectual property they paid for.

### 🛠️ Exploit-Eliminating Fixes
Every fix is validated to fully close the exploit — not reduce it, not delay it. Includes rewritten clauses that are bilateral, objective, and enforceable — with actual contract language, not descriptions.

### 📊 Prioritized Risk Report
Issues ranked by financial impact and likelihood of abuse — so you know exactly what to fix first.

## 🧠 How The Analysis Works

RiskRadar runs a **4-phase adversarial analysis engine**:

```
Phase 1 — Clause Analysis
  └─ Tag every clause → identify structural defect
     → validate fix eliminates exploit, not just reduces it

Phase 2 — Ownership Block Detection
  └─ Scan IP transfer conditions → detect completion control
     → flag Payment + Completion + IP as CRITICAL

Phase 3 — Cross-Clause Intelligence
  └─ Map 8 mandatory relationship checks
     → generate step-by-step exploit chains

Phase 4 — Abuse Scenario Enforcement
  └─ Minimum 3 typed scenarios required
     → each step names the clause that permits it
     → financial impact + legal impact both required
```

## 🎯 What RiskRadar Detects

| Risk Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 💸 Payment Loss | Upfront payments with no delivery guarantee or refund |
| 🪤 Acceptance Trap | Silence-based acceptance that binds you to defective work |
| 🔒 Ownership Block | Paying in full but never legally receiving the IP you bought |
| 🚪 Termination Exploit | One party exits while keeping your money and delivering nothing |
| ⚡ Unilateral Control | "Sole discretion", "deemed complete", "as determined by" |
| 🔗 Exploit Chains | Multi-clause combos that look fine alone but combine dangerously |
| 🤖 Data Weaponization | Perpetual data licenses and AI training rights on your business data |
| ⚖️ Rigged Arbitration | Arbitrator, venue, language, and rules all chosen by one party |
